# Staking & Unstaking PRV

## Staking PRV

If you are holding PRV and want to get rewards you will need to stake them. We show you how in the video below:

{% hint style="info" %}
PRV must be staked in the PRV Locker for a full staking epoch before rewards can be claimed. However, users need only do this once: staked tokens continue to earn rewards in perpetuity until the PRV is unstaked.
{% endhint %}

## Unstaking PRV

If you want to unstake your PRV in order to transfer them, you can as well. See how in the video below.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Staked PRV can be withdrawn at any time and transferred, but once withdrawn, the user would have to re-deposit and wait for a full epoch to finish before being eligible for rewards.
