# Rewards Vaults

The Auxo DAO distributed every month the yield resulting from the treasury farming operations. Users staking $AUXO will be entitled to receive a portion of that yield as reward. Each vault will distribute WETH and the amount is given by different factors as explained in this section.

🗳️ Choose ARV if you are willing to commit to active governance while receiving the highest possible returns (rewards)

⛱️ Choose PRV if you are willing to be passive on governance by holding a governance free and transferable asset.

> Is a non-transferable asset that will allow you to get monthly rewards for governing the DAO. It receives 70% of rewards, can be redeemed for AUXO after the lock expiration, and has the option to exit to PRV by paying a 20% early lock termination fee. Rewards are distributed on a monthly basis to active holders (who voted during the previous month). The amount will be subject to a level system that boosts the rewards of those with longer expiration dates — levels decay on a monthly basis, and should be boosted periodically to maximize the rewards received.
