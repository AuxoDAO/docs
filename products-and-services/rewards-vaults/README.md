# Rewards Vaults

\
Every month, the Auxo DAO distributes 100% of the yield resulting from its treasury farming operations to Auxo stakers.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
On Sep 6, 2023 the DAO has voted to dissolve and enable redemption of treasury assets. The DAO is no longer operating. Read more on [treasury-redemption.md](../../usdauxo/treasury-redemption.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

Users staking $AUXO have two options: The Auxo _Active Rewards Vault (ARV)_ or the Auxo _Passive Rewards Vaults (PRV)_ will be entitled to receive a portion of that yield as reward. As a Tl;dr:

🗳️ **Choose ARV** if you are willing to commit to active governance while receiving the highest possible returns (rewards)

⛱️ **Choose PRV** if you are willing to be passive on governance by holding a governance-free and transferable asset.

Each vault will distribute WETH, and the amount is given by different factors as explained in the following sections.

> Is a non-transferable asset that yields monthly rewards for governing the DAO. It receives 70% of total rewards, can be redeemed for AUXO after an unlock date, and has the option to exit to PRV by paying a 20% early lock termination fee. Rewards are distributed on a monthly basis to active holders (who voted during the previous month). The amount will be subject to a level system that boosts the rewards of those with longer expiration dates — levels decay on a monthly basis, and should be boosted periodically to maximize the rewards received.

> Is a transferable asset that yields monthly rewards while being free from governance obligations. PRV requires users to be staked for an entire epoch to qualify for distribution. 30% of the Treasury Farming will be distributed monthly as rewards to all qualifying PRV. The ARV→PRV conversion is irreversible, but PRV can be withdrawn for AUXO (subject to budget availability and a fee).

{% hint style="success" %}
Rewards can be claimed as long as the address exists in any of the merkle trees, regardless if it has an active lock or not.
