Auxo is a DeFi platform that offers trust-minimized farming, rewards in ETH, and non-dilutive tokenomics. With Auxo, you can farm on high-yield protocols multichain with confidence, earn rewards in ETH instead of tokens, and benefit from a token policy that puts existing holders first.

#### Trust-minimized farming DAO

There are many ways in which one can generate yield in the crypto space: one can stake, lend, run a validator, delegate, provide liquidity, etc.

Each of these different ways to earn a yield on one‚Äôs assets comes with a series of different risks and rewards. For example, if one is staking 32 ETH, they must ensure that their validator behaves appropriately, or they risk their stake being slashed. If one lends out stablecoins on platforms such as Aave and Compound, they must take on protocol risk, if one provides liquidity on a platform like Uniswap, they must be wary of the risks of impermanent loss, and yield farming can be problematic thanks to the risk of dilution.

Auxo is designed in such a way that many of these risks are minimised and removed.

Auxo is a DAO that is focused on trust-minimised yield farming that generates real yield on assets without dilution and pays WETH rewards to stakers monthly.

This is achieved by leveraging the hive mind of the DAO to employ a variety of different strategies on different chains to generate the highest possible yields for the DAO treasury. The yields that the DAO generates each month are then distributed completely to the Rewards Vaults.



### **What is the role of the DAO?**

AUXO DAO's governance is designed to ensure resilience and decentralization of the system. ARV holders play a variety of roles, including notarization and transparency, authorization and access control, and issuing liquidity events. The community's voting promotes transparency in strategy performance, setup, operation, and composition. ARV holders control the Treasury's authorization layer, allowing only authorized transactions to be executed by Treasury operators. ARV holders can add and remove Treasury Operators at any time, reducing operational risks and expanding governance capabilities.
