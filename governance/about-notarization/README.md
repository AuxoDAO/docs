# About Notarization

### Rewards Distribution and Eligibility in a nutshell

Every month the DAO will distribute 100% of its farming yield to the ARV and PRV vaults in a 70%/30% ratio. ARV and PRV token holders will receive rewards in WETH if they are eligible.

* ARV holders are eligible only if they voted at least once during the EPOCH. All votes count, regardless if on-chain or off-chain.
* PRV holders are eligible if they have staked their tokens for the entire [EPOCH](https://docs.auxo.fi/auxo-docs/rewards-vaults/prv-passive-rewards-vault#how-staking-works-in-prv).

{% hint style="warning" %}
On-chain voting requires _self-delegation_ before a vote can be considered valid.
