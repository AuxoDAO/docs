# The Notarization Process

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LFCnYeUNKA" %}

1.  **EPOCH CLOSURE**

    Operators will issue a snapshot at the start of each month to list eligible addresses for rewards (merkle tree) and prepare the distribution amounts.
2.  **NOTARIZATION VOTE**

    An off-chain vote will be cast with the link to the report, the merkle tree with the addresses & amounts, and the EPOCH window timestamps.
3.  **ARV HOLDERS NOTARIZATION**

    Holders will vote VALID if they find no issues with the distribution, and INVALID if they see an issue with their addressâ€™ eligibility or amount.
4.  **DISTRIBUTION EXECUTION**

    Operators distribute rewards to ARV and PRV vaults.

**In a nutshell**

* If you voted last month, then your address should be in the Merkle Tree. **Vote VALID if it is, and INVALID if it is not**.
* If you did not vote last month, then your address should not be in the Merkle Tree. **Vote INVALID if it is, and VALID if it is not**.
